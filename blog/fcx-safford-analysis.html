        <h3>Investment Analysis Context (FCX Ticker)</h3>
        <h4>Financial Snapshot (as of recent data):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company Name:</strong> Freeport-McMoRan Inc.</li>
            <li><strong>Sector/Industry:</strong> Basic Materials / Copper</li>
            <li><strong>Price:</strong> ~$38.42</li>
            <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> ~$55.21 Billion</li>
            <li><strong>P/E Ratio (TTM):</strong> ~29.39</li>
            <li><strong>Dividend Yield (TTM):</strong> ~1.56%</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Synthesized Overview (Based on FMP, Brave, Perplexity):</h4>
        <p>FCX benefits from strong copper demand driven by global electrification and renewable energy trends. Its strategic assets in Arizona and globally provide scale. Recent dividend declarations signal financial health.</p>
        <p>However, the stock carries a relatively high P/E ratio, suggesting potential valuation concerns. The company is exposed to volatile commodity prices and geopolitical risks in its operating regions (including Indonesia and South America). Recent news indicates potential benefits from copper tariffs but also highlights institutional selling.</p>
        <p>The investment outlook balances significant long-term potential from copper demand against valuation risks and operational challenges.</p>
